# Real Time Bus Tracker

## Description

Real Time Bus Tracker is a web application built using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The project utilizes the Google Maps JavaScript API to display the route of a specific bus route in Newport Beach, California, and tracks the real-time location of the bus along that route.

Improvements made to the project include:
- Enhanced user interface design for better user experience.
- Implemented real-time tracking functionality using the Google Maps API.
